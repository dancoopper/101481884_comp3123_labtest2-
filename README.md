## [Working Demo](https://one01481884-comp3123-labtest2.onrender.com/)
## This is the search screen 
![search](/public/Search.png)
### This is the first screen you see when you open the app, it has a search bar and a search button and lets the user search for a city.
## This is the weather screen 
![weather](/public/Denver.png)
### When the user puts a city in and presses the search button the app will make a call to the OpenWether Api and get a bunch of wether data. The app will then display some of that data.
